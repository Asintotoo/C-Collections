# C-Collections
Data Structures for C

## How to Use
Just include the necessary data structure in your C file by using the ```#include``` directive (e.g., ```#include "LinkedList.c"```).

All the data structures are designed to handle **generi**c content, which means that you will need to define the appropriate functions based on the specific data type you intend to use.

See some examples [here](https://github.com/Asintotoo/C-Collections/tree/main/test)

## Current Data Structures
- [X] LinkedList
- [X] HashSet
- [X] HashMap
- [X] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Deque
- [ ] Binary Tree
- [ ] Graph
